This quote and excellent observation, comes from [Aral Balkan](http://twitter.com/aral) and is from the new [Smashing Book #3](http://smashingbook.com/) (Which I also had the pleasure of reviewing).  







I'm not going to go into a lengthy blog post about web vs. native, Aral does a good enough job at that, but this is an interesting way of seeing the current situation from another perspective: Native applications are now getting features like [deeplinking](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/ios/build/#linktoapp), automatic app updates and can in many ways be built to behave more like the web. While on the other side, the web strives to behave more like native by getting more access to the device. 







If we disregard Angry Birds, [the most used app in the world](http://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-the-most-popular-mobile-apps-of-2011-2011-12) is Facebook. And it's a hybrid app. Clear evidence that picking the best of both worlds is the way to go? In many ways, it's a compromise, but hey, isn't everything we do a compromise?
