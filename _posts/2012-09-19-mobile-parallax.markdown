It has annoyed me for some time that parallax sites does not work on mobile devices (or rather, people that make parallax websites does make them work on mobile). But at a workshop at [@ValtechSweden](twitter.com/valtechsweden) we came over [stellar.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/) which is a script that together with [iScroll4](http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) will make this work on mobile devices as well. Of course, it is not just a matter of using the script, you will need to apply some responsive magic to make it work, but it is actually quite promising. I set up a ** very simple** demo here: [http://andmag.se/parallax](http://andmag.se/parallax).





_**WARNING: ** Kids, please try this at home, but think twice before applying it at work. Parallax effects may cause enthusiastic clients, but very sad and dizzy end users. And kittens may die._
