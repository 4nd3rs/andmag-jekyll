A question popped to my head when doing some work on a site that is using Modernizr: "What do people mainly use Modernizr for?". I asked [Paul Irish](http://twitter.com/paul_irish) on Twitter and he generously shared the [last 30 days of Modernizr build data](https://t.co/C7tWToww). It does not say anything of how much people actually use the features, but it says something about what they intend to use. I took the stats and did a simple sort and count (without weighing in how much each build is used...). 

<!-- more -->


All the top results were "functions", not specific feature tests, which tells us that Modernizr is actually used more as a JavaScript framework than anything else. I have listed some of the most used functions and feature tests below. Full list is [here](https://t.co/C7tWToww) (at sheet 2).






### Top functions






  1. load


  2. cssclasses


  3. testprop


  4. testallprops


  5. shiv


  6. teststyles


  7. prefixes


  8. hasevent





### Top feature tests






  1. boxshadow


  2. csstransitions


  3. textshadow


  4. rgba


  5. opacity


  6. cssgradients


  7. borderradius


  8. canvastext


  9. csstransforms3d


  10. multiplebgs


  11. canvas





Not sure if it is ok to classify Modernizr like this... Let me know in the comments of you have another opinion or comment on the "stats".
