Some interesting observations:







  * Many variants of 320: 320x480, 320x452, 320x401, 320x450 etc. Devices has different height, but it also comes from different webviews of applications such as Twitter and Facebook. Remember that [height matters](http://amobil.se/2012/01/height-matters/).


  * 0x0. This "screen resolution" is forgotten by many developers. It probably comes from apps like screen readers and robots.


  * 30720x768. Not sure what's going on here, but I Googled it and it seems quite common. I doubt that it is a physical screen, anyone know what it is?
